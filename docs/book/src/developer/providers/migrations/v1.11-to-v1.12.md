### Suggested changes for providers

* For providers that copied the core Cluster API v1beta1 `APIEndpoint` struct and used it in their InfraCluster Go type 
  it is recommended to now make the `Host` and `Port` fields optional (they already have been made optional in 
  `clusterv1beta1.APIEndpoint` in Cluster API v1.12).
  tl;dr The fields were previously required, but due to side effects that validation was never enforced. These side
  effects might go away which then makes the fields suddenly required. To avoid issues we recommend making the fields
  optional. Similar to how they are optional in the v1beta2 `APIEndpoint` struct and v1beta2 InfraCluster contract.
  For more details, please see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/12634#discussion_r2275468291.
  But this might look differently depending on how your InfraCluster Go type and corresponding mutating webhook evolved over time.
