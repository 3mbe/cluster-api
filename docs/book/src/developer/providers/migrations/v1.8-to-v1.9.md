### Suggested changes for providers

- The Errors package was created when capi provider implementation was running as machineActuators that needed to vendor core capi to function. There is no usage recommendations today and its value is questionable since we moved to CRDs that inter-operate mostly via conditions. Instead we plan to drop the dedicated semantic for terminal failure and keep improving Machine lifecycle signal through conditions. Therefore the Errors package [has been deprecated in v1.8](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/10784). It's recommented to remove any usage of the currently exported variables.
